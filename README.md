# Weather-Dashboard


This applicaiton is a weather dashboard with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. This application utilizes the AJAX to hook into OpenWeather API to retrieve data in JSON format. Using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery we can show the user the follwoing information:
Displayed the following under current weather conditions:
- City
- Date
- Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- UV index

Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:
- Date
- Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
- Temperature
- Humidity

It also includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name that populates under the search bar after their initial search, will perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city
